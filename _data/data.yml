    summary: |
      <span id="hi">Hi</span>, I'm Shuo Li, am currently a master's student in the University of Edinburgh, majoring in Signal Processing & Commmunications.
      
      I am concentrated on Matlab-based/Java-based programming, and most familiar with Embedded System, Distributed System, and Signal Processing. 
      The projects I am most proud of are:

      - <span class="span-as-link" id="node-project-link">Design of Spectrally-Efficient Distributed Spatial Modulation(DSM)</span>
      - <span class="span-as-link" id="node-project2-link">Design of Music Recommender System</span>
      - <span class="span-as-link" id="node-project-link">Design of Portable & Handwriting-Specifiable Smart Pen</span>
      - <span class="span-as-link" id="node-project-link">Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy for Mobile Gas Sensing</span>
      
      I am now actively seeking 2019 PHD opportunity. If you have any position available, please
      contact me!

        Simulated & Developed a Spectrally-Efficient DSM Communication System based on Matlab

          - Implemented the Conventional DSM system model.
          - Analyzed different modulation/demodulation schemes (e.g STBC).
          - Proposed new protocols for generalized DSM, which allows more than one antennas to be activated during broadcasting & relaying phases.
          - Analyzed the trade-off between Spectral Efficiency and Energy Efficiency.

        Developed a Music Recommender System

          - Analyzed source code of website 'www.music163.com', extracting the URLs of interest.
          - Implemented Akka-based distributed web crawlers.
          - Coordinated Master and Slave operation modes.
          - Processed the output logs, recommending new music that is more likely to be preferred by users.
