  description: "My main projects are listed here. You can find more projects in my GitHub."

- project: CSDT - Sparse Deep Neural Network Toolkit
  title: <a href="https://github.com/wyq730/CSLT-Sparse-DNN-Toolkit">CSDT - Sparse Deep Neural Network Toolkit</a>
  #link: "#""
  tagline: "CSLT Sparse DNN Toolkit (CSDT) is an open source toolkit for implementation and exploration of sparse deep neural networks in speech recogniton. It's built on Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit and it's released for further research on sparse deep neural networks."

- project: Demo for Driving Distraction Detection
  title: <a href="https://github.com/wyq730/Demo-of-Driving-Distraction-Detection">Demo for Driving Distraction Detection</a>
  #link: "#""
  tagline: "In my research, I developed a SDA-based driving distraction approach that discovers prominent features from raw spectrum of EEG data using SDA. Based on the features we extracted, we could then utilize support vector machines (SVM) to detect whether a driver is focused on driving. This program is a demo of the detection system."

- project: OpenCV-based Image-processing Application
  title: <a href="https://github.com/wyq730/Image-Processing-System-Based-on-OpenCV">OpenCV-based Image-processing Application</a>
  tagline: "A simplified Photoshop-like photo processing application based on OpenCV. Using the application, you can convert your original photos into creative styles with a simply click of your mouse."
